    "When a file is opened, the operating system reserves certain resources for it, such as memory and disk space. If a program opens a large number of files and doesn't close them properly, it can lead to resource leaks and even crash the program or the operating system.\n",

    "Closing a file frees up the resources that were being used by the file, so that they can be used by other programs or processes. It also ensures that any changes made to the file are written to disk before the file is closed.\n",

    "If you don't close a file, any changes made to the file may not be saved, and the file may become corrupted or unreadable. In addition, leaving a file open can prevent other programs or processes from accessing the file, which can cause issues in a multi-user environment."
